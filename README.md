This document outlines the design and implementation of a Hospital management application for a doctors appointment booking module. Utilizing Java's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, we've created a robust system that handles the doctors appointment schedule for bookings.

The second file(HoapitalManagementApp file) is a modified version of the code we had created previuosly. We've added some modules such as buttons,icons and labels for a user friendly interface.
